# Hi! Aaron here! This repository is a collection of projects performed on the Apple TV 1st Generation (2006)
# If you'd like to contribute to helping turn this into a portable, I am in need of datasheets on the Delta Electronics ADP-36BF for it's pinout
# This page is also dedicated to the modding and improvement of the device, mainly keeping it cool!
# I do not use apps like discord, so please email me first before getting in contact.
# Just again to say, I am very new to Github, so if i'm doing something wrong, feel free to correct me!
