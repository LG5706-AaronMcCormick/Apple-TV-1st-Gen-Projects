This is a list of operating system images for the Apple TV 1st Gen. I'm not sure if they are open source, So i'll just put direct download links.

#### [Mac OS X 10.5.8 V2](https://archive.org/download/mac-os-x-leopard-apple-tv/Apple%20TV%20HD%2010_6_8.dmg) (MacOS DMG File) * This is an improved version of the inital 10.5.8 release

I would reccomend OS X 10.5.8 V2 for best performance and stability, but I'm not making decisions for you!
