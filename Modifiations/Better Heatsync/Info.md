# Better Heatsinc Mod
## ⚠️ Mod is under development ⚠️

This mod provides a more optimised heatsink and cooling system whilst using mostly stock parts

### Needed:
1x Short standoff (not sure what size, just small enough to elevate the fan slightly)
1x Short screw (pick a screw, any screw! As long as it fits)
Screwdriver (duh)
2x Heatsyncs + thermal PAD (the pad is important because it needs to stick the heatsyncs to the main heatsync

### Instructions:

1. Remove the fan from the device
2. insert your standoff into the bottom-right hole on the PCB
3. Turn the fan upside down and make sure the outlet is facing opposite the rear of the board
4. screw the bottom-right fan screw into the standoff, securing it in place
5. apply the thermal pad closest to the outlet of the fan, not on the PCB though!
6. attach the heatsyncs facing away from the outlet
